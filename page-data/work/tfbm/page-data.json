I served as Co-Director and Lead Game designer on the project, designing the mechanics of the game, managing our programming and art teams and delivering creative vision for the project.</p>\n<p>The genesis of the project was in a novel motion control system for mobile devices that we were pitching to Hasbro. I helped prototype this system, using infrared LEDs and an IR-pass filter to provide a low cost motion control scheme that could work with mobile devices. Although the motion control component of the project never materialized due to hardware costing concerns, the proposal did yield a mobile title that would become Transformers: Battlemasters.</p>\n<p>The game was built using the Unity 3D Engine and released in the Apple App Store for iOS and Google Play store for Android</p>\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/PmcodJwE2F4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Transformers: Battlemasters","routename":"tfbm"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/work/tfbm/"}}}
